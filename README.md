# US-Accidents-EDA-Project
Exploratory Data Analysis to extract insights from large and complex datasets (7.7 million accident records), facilitating data-driven decision-making. By analyzing US-Accidents history, this project aids in preventing accidents, improving resources, and shaping policies for safer roads and a safer society.

-Conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sizable dataset documenting US-Accidents history from 2016 to 2023.
-Proficiently employing Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium, they expertly handled data preprocessing and manipulation.
-Through insightful visualizations including graphs, histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps, revealed intricate accident patterns by city and time.
-Leveraging Folium,conducted geospatial analysis, pinpointing accident locations on interactive maps.
